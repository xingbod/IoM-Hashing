# AGREEMENT ON THE USE OF IoM Hashing ALGORITHM AND ANY GENERATED DATA

I agree:

1. To cite [1] [2] in any paper of mine or my collaborators that makes any use of the codes or data generated from these codes.
2. To use the codes and generated data for research purposes only.
3. Not to provide the codes or generated data to third parties without the notice of authors (Z. Jin, Y.L. Lai and A. B. J. Teoh) and this agreement.

=== Setup === 
1. Unzip IoM_Vector_full.rar into the "IoM_Vector_full" folder
   - Can be obtained from https://www.dropbox.com/s/r7yvbky8r19ta87/IoM_Vector_full.zip?dl=0 
   

=== Project descriptions ===
1. \GRP_IoM
   - GRP based IoM method
   - run GRP_IoM.m
   - hashed code stores GRP_IoM\maxout
2. \URP_IoM
   - GRP based IoM method
   - run URP_IoM.m
   - hashed code stores URP_IoM\wta
3. \data
   - store fixed-length feature vectors as input of IoM hash (both GRP and URP)
